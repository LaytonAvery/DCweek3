      The domestic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">dog</a> (Canis
      familiaris when considered a separate species or Canis lupus familiaris
      when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a wolf-like canid[6][7]
      and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[8][9] The dog and
      the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely
      related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[10][11][12] which
      implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[13] The dog was
      the first species to be domesticated[12][14] by hunterâ€“gatherers more than
      15,000 years ago,[15] which predates agriculture.[1] Since then, the dog
      has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
      capabilities and physical attributes.[16]
